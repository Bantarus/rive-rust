# Building `rive-rust`

Renders a `.riv` file's default state machine to an offscreen image using the
**native Rive Renderer** (rive-runtime's PLS renderer, Vulkan backend), reads the
pixels back, and writes a PNG. The shim manages its **own** `VkInstance`/`VkDevice`
— there is no wgpu or Bevy yet.

Builds on **Linux** (clang — §1) and **native Windows** (clang-cl via the relay —
§1b). M0 brought up Linux; M1.0 added Windows.

```
# Linux:
cargo run --example offscreen_png -- assets/coffee_loader.riv out.png
# Windows (via the relay):
scripts\win.cmd run --release --example offscreen_png -- assets\coffee_loader.riv out_win.png
```

## 1. Prerequisites

| Tool | Used in this milestone | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rust (stable) | `rustc 1.94.1` | build the crates |
| clang / clang++ | `18.1.3` | compile rive-runtime + the C++ shim (gcc is **not** supported — rive relies on clang vector builtins) |
| premake5 | `5.0.0-beta2` (vendored) | generate rive-runtime's makefiles |
| GNU make | `4.3` | run the generated makefiles + the shader build |
| python3 | `3.12.3` | rive's offline shader minify/codegen |
| glslangValidator | `15.1.0` (`glslang-tools`) | compile rive's Vulkan GLSL → SPIR-V |
| spirv-opt | `2025.1` (`spirv-tools`) | optimize rive's SPIR-V |
| git | `2.43` | premake clones Vulkan-Headers / VMA / harfbuzz / … at configure time |
| Vulkan loader | `libvulkan.so.1` + `libvulkan-dev` | link `-lvulkan`; a working ICD at runtime |

### Install (Ubuntu 24.04 / WSL2)

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y clang make python3 glslang-tools spirv-tools libvulkan-dev pkg-config vulkan-tools
```

`premake5` is **not** in apt, and the binary is **not** committed (binaries
don't belong in git). Fetch the pinned `5.0.0-beta2` Linux binary (matching
rive-runtime's own Dockerfile) into `tools/premake5`, which is git-ignored:

```bash
tools/fetch_premake.sh
```

`build.rs` looks for premake5 in this order: `$PREMAKE5` → `tools/premake5` → `PATH`.

The Vulkan **headers** themselves are *not* required from the system: premake
clones `KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers` (pinned `vulkan-sdk-1.4.321`) and
`VulkanMemoryAllocator` (`v3.3.0`) into `.rive-deps/` and the shim compiles
against those. `libvulkan-dev` is only needed for the loader's dev symlink.

---

## 1b. Building on Windows (native, M1.0)

The same example builds and runs natively on Windows with the MSVC-family
toolchain and the **native NVIDIA Vulkan** driver — **no Vulkan SDK** and **no
rive-runtime patches**. Full detail + gotchas: **[docs/M1_0_REPORT.md](docs/M1_0_REPORT.md)**.

### Prerequisites (Windows)

| Tool | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Visual Studio 2022 | **Desktop development with C++** + **C++ Clang tools for Windows** (clang-cl is rive's default toolset; `cl.exe` can't compile rive's sources) |
| Rust (stable ≥ 1.94) | `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` (`rustup update stable`) |
| premake5 **beta7** | `tools\fetch_premake.cmd` → `tools/premake5.exe` (beta2 mis-emits `/weAll` for the VS generator) |
| GNU make | e.g. `choco install make` (rive's shader step shells out to `make`) |
| Git for Windows | provides `sh` for make's recipes, and `git` for dep clones |
| python 3 | rive's shader minify |
| Vulkan SDK | **on CI / clean checkouts** — `glslangValidator` + `spirv-opt` generate rive's SPIR-V. Skipped locally if the tree already has prebuilt SPIR-V (below) |
| NVIDIA driver | provides `vulkan-1.dll` at runtime (loaded via `LoadLibraryA`) — no Vulkan import lib to link |

**SPIR-V provenance (hermeticity).** rive's Vulkan SPIR-V comes from the Vulkan
SDK (`glslangValidator`/`spirv-opt`) in rive's shader step. **CI** installs the
SDK and generates it on a clean checkout (`.github/workflows/windows.yml`) — the
hermetic path, no Linux dependency. As a **local optimization**, a working tree
that already carries the prebuilt
`renderer/out/rive-rust-m0/include/generated/shaders/spirv/*.h` (e.g. synced from
a Linux build) skips that step. `build.rs` **fails early with a clear remedy** if
neither the SDK nor prebuilt SPIR-V is present. The D3D shaders rive always builds
on Windows use the Windows SDK's `fxc`; Vulkan is loaded at runtime via
`LoadLibraryA("vulkan-1.dll")` (no import lib).

> **Perf note (updated M2.0):** a **dev** build links **debug** rive libs (fast
> iteration; timings not meaningful). A **`--release`** build links **optimized**
> rive libs — `build.rs` follows Cargo's `PROFILE`. On Windows the release libs
> are optimized **COFF** that the default `link.exe` consumes (no `lld-link`
> needed; rive's `LinkTimeOptimization` flag doesn't reach clang-cl through
> MSBuild). On Linux, release adds `--no-lto` so `ld` gets ELF, not LLVM bitcode.
> First real perf baseline: [docs/M2_0_REPORT.md](docs/M2_0_REPORT.md).

### Build & run (via the relay)

The canonical repo lives on the Linux/WSL2 side; copy it to a real Windows path
(MSBuild/MSVC don't work over `\\wsl.localhost` UNC) and build there:

```bash
# from WSL2:
scripts/sync_to_windows.sh        # rsync working tree -> E:\DEV\rive-rust
cmd.exe /c "scripts\win.cmd run --release --example offscreen_png -- assets\coffee_loader.riv out_win.png"
```

```
:: or from a native Windows terminal at E:\DEV\rive-rust:
scripts\win.cmd run --release --example offscreen_png -- assets\coffee_loader.riv out_win.png
```

`scripts\win.cmd` locates VS via `vswhere`, sources `vcvars64.bat` (x64), puts
clang-cl + `make` + Git Bash `sh` on PATH, then forwards args to `cargo`.
`.cargo/config.toml` links the static CRT (`+crt-static`) to match rive's forced
`/MT`. On Windows `build.rs` runs `premake5 vs2022` → MSBuild (ClangCL/x64) and
compiles the shim with clang-cl; it emits **no** Vulkan link directive.

---

## 2. Submodule

rive-runtime is a git submodule under `vendor/`, pinned to commit
`3f868558a4596e153afdb6bc3e8058596f0d971d` (`.version` 0.1). After cloning this
repo:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

---

## 3. What `build.rs` does (crates/rive-renderer-sys)

1. Detects the tools above and fails with an actionable message if any are missing.
2. Runs `premake5 gmake2` **from `vendor/rive-runtime/renderer/`** with
   `--config=debug --out=out/rive-rust-m0 --with_vulkan --with_rive_text --with_rive_layout`.
   - Working directory matters: premake anchors `RIVE_BUILD_OUT` and the
     generated-shader include path to its CWD, so it must run from `renderer/`.
   - `--out` must be **relative** (premake concatenates it onto the CWD).
   - This step also runs rive's offline shader build (needs python3 + make +
     glslangValidator + spirv-opt), and clones the pinned deps into `.rive-deps/`
     (`$DEPENDENCIES`).
3. Runs `make -C <out> config=default -j<N>` with **explicit** library targets
   (never `all`, which would build the `path_fiddle` demo and require GLFW):
   `rive rive_pls_renderer rive_decoders libpng zlib libjpeg libwebp rive_harfbuzz rive_sheenbidi rive_yoga`.
4. Compiles `shim/rive_shim.cpp` **plus rive's `rive_vk_bootstrap` sources** with
   clang (`-std=c++17 -fno-rtti -DRIVE_VULKAN -DVK_NO_PROTOTYPES`). `rive_vk_bootstrap`
   is *not* built into any rive static lib, so it is compiled into the shim here.
5. Emits the link directives (static rive libs in single-pass order, then
   `-lvulkan -lstdc++ -lpthread -ldl -lm`).

Artifacts land in `vendor/rive-runtime/renderer/out/rive-rust-m0/` and
`.rive-deps/` (both git-ignored). A clean rebuild: `cargo clean` and delete
those two directories.

> The rive libs follow Cargo's `PROFILE` (M2.0): a dev build → **debug** libs, a
> `--release` build → **optimized release** libs, in separate out dirs. Release
> disables rive's LTO by default (`RIVE_RUNTIME_NO_LTO`) so each platform's stock
> linker handles the objects — Linux `ld` needs ELF not bitcode, and Windows
> link.exe already gets COFF. Force the config with `RIVE_RUNTIME_CONFIG=release`.
> See [docs/M2_0_REPORT.md](docs/M2_0_REPORT.md) §Task 1.

## 4. Runtime environment variables

- `RIVE_GPU=<substring>` — pick a GPU by name substring (`integrated` selects an
  integrated GPU). Useful on WSL2 to choose between `Dozen` and `llvmpipe`.
- `RIVE_FORCE_ATOMIC=1` — force the renderer's atomic PLS path (fallback when
  fragment-shader-interlock / rasterizer-ordered access is unavailable).

---

## 5. Gotchas hit while bringing M0 up

- **premake-on-Linux**: works with the official `5.0.0-beta2` binary. Must run
  from `renderer/`; `--out` relative; the only make *configuration* is literally
  `default` (debug/release is baked at premake time). See §3.
- **Double-`lib` archive names**: premake prefixes `lib`, so the `libpng` /
  `libjpeg` / `libwebp` projects produce `liblibpng.a` / `liblibjpeg.a` /
  `liblibwebp.a` (link names `libpng` / `libjpeg` / `libwebp`). `zlib` →
  `libzlib.a`, `rive` → `librive.a`.
- **Link order** (single-pass GNU ld, no `--start-group` needed because the
  graph is acyclic): shim → `rive_pls_renderer` → `rive` → `rive_decoders` →
  `libpng` → `zlib` → `libjpeg` → `libwebp` → `rive_harfbuzz` →
  `rive_sheenbidi` → `rive_yoga` → system libs.
- **`rive_vk_bootstrap` is not a static lib** — compile its sources into the shim.
- **WSL2 / NVIDIA**: there is **no native NVIDIA Vulkan ICD** under WSL2 — only
  `Dozen` (Mesa's Vulkan→D3D12 layer wrapping the RTX 4090) and `llvmpipe` (CPU).
  Neither is likely to expose `VK_EXT_fragment_shader_interlock` /
  `VK_EXT_rasterization_order_attachment_access`, so the renderer uses its
  **atomic** fallback path. This is correct, just slower, and is the main thing
  M1's wgpu shared-device plan must account for. If `Dozen` misbehaves, set
  `RIVE_GPU=llvmpipe` for a guaranteed-correct (software) reference image.
- **Color contract** (so M1 has a trustworthy reference to diff against): the
  offscreen target is `VK_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM` (non-sRGB → no hardware gamma
  conversion; the bytes are sRGB-encoded, exactly what a PNG wants — **do not**
  apply gamma). The renderer outputs **premultiplied** alpha. **Orientation:**
  rive's Vulkan backend renders top-down, but `getPixelsFromLastImageCopy` flips
  rows to a GL-style bottom-up convention (rive's own PNG writer flips a *second*
  time to compensate). The shim flips back, so `read_pixels` returns genuine
  **top-down** RGBA8 — encode the PNG with no extra flip. (Skipping this flip
  renders the image upside down.) The example clears to an **opaque** color,
  making premultiplied == straight; for a transparent background, call
  `rive_renderer::unpremultiply_rgba8`.

---

## 6. Version triple to pin for M1 (do NOT add these yet)

M1 introduces wgpu shared-device interop. The Bevy ↔ wgpu ↔ ash versions must
match **exactly** (`as_hal` / `create_texture_from_hal` are unstable internal
wgpu APIs, and a raw `ash` version must match the one wgpu was built against).
When M1 starts, pin and record the triple here, e.g.:

```
bevy = "0.XX"      # ships wgpu X.Y
wgpu = "X.Y"       # must match Bevy's pinned wgpu exactly
ash  = "0.Z"       # must match wgpu's ash
```

Treat every Bevy bump as a deliberate interop re-validation, not a `cargo update`.

---

## 7. Test assets

`assets/` contains small, vector-only samples copied from rive-runtime's own
`renderer/webgpu_player/rivs/`:

- `coffee_loader.riv` (default) — a small vector loader animation.
- `octopus_loop.riv` — a looping vector animation.

More `.riv` files: rive's [awesome-rive](https://github.com/rive-app/awesome-rive)
repo, or anything exported from the Rive editor. M0 uses no image decoders for
its samples; an image-bearing `.riv` would need the (already-linked) decoders.

---

## 8. Prebuilt rive libraries — skip the C++ toolchain (M-PKG.1)

A consumer of `bevy-rive` normally inherits this crate's full C++ build (premake +
clang + the rive static libs + the shim). To take that off a consumer's hot path,
`crates/rive-renderer-sys/build.rs` honours **`RIVE_PREBUILT_LIBS=<dir>`**: when set it
links pre-archived libraries from `<dir>` and **skips premake/make/clang *and* the
rive-runtime submodule entirely**. It prints `cargo:warning=… linking PREBUILT libs …`
so the path taken is obvious, and fails fast (listing what is absent) if an archive is
missing.

`<dir>` must hold every archive a from-source build produces — the ten rive static libs
plus the shim archive, in the platform's naming:

| Platform | rive libs (× 10) | shim |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux (GNU `ar`) | `librive_pls_renderer.a`, `librive.a`, `librive_decoders.a`, `liblibpng.a`, `libzlib.a`, `liblibjpeg.a`, `liblibwebp.a`, `librive_harfbuzz.a`, `librive_sheenbidi.a`, `librive_yoga.a` | `librive_shim.a` |
| Windows (MSVC) | same stems as `rive_pls_renderer.lib`, `rive.lib`, `rive_decoders.lib`, `libpng.lib`, `zlib.lib`, `libjpeg.lib`, `libwebp.lib`, `rive_harfbuzz.lib`, `rive_sheenbidi.lib`, `rive_yoga.lib` | `rive_shim.lib` |

### Producing the archive

Build once from source, then collect the artifacts into one directory:

```bash
# 1. a normal from-source build produces the rive libs (in the vendored out/ dir) and
#    the shim archive (in the build's OUT_DIR). dev shown; release uses -release paths.
cargo build -p bevy-rive

# 2. collect them
mkdir -p prebuilt/linux-dev
cp vendor/rive-runtime/renderer/out/rive-rust-m0/*.a                                   prebuilt/linux-dev/
cp "$(ls -t target/debug/build/rive-renderer-sys-*/out/librive_shim.a | head -1)"      prebuilt/linux-dev/

# 3. a consumer (or this repo) then links them with NO C++ toolchain / submodule:
RIVE_PREBUILT_LIBS="$PWD/prebuilt/linux-dev" cargo build -p bevy-rive
```

`tools/archive_prebuilt.sh [out_dir] [--release]` automates steps 1–2 for the host.

The archive is **ABI-specific** — it is tied to the toolchain, the Cargo profile
(debug/release link different rive libs), and the target triple. Ship one set per
target. Per-platform binary *hosting* + CI (so consumers never build C++ at all) is the
follow-on; this milestone establishes the link mechanism.
